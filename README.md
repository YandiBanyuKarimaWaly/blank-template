# Blank Template
An opinionated set of dependency and structure for a javascript projects. Can be anything from CLI to web services. Maybe a bit of both (standalone application). Using PNPM because I am not a node_modules hoarder.

## How to use
Simply do:
```
pnpm install
```
From there, add anything that you needed.

---

Also provide a convenient script for development which is:
```
pnpm dev
```
It will start a typescript compiler in watch mode AND nodemon to auto-restart the proccess.
